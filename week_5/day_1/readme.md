#SQL Day 1

## Problem
We were given a task to create a database capable of storing all relevant data for a transaction from amazon.
We were told what kind of information was available and was given free reign on the relation ships.

## Solution

### ERD

## Folder Structure:
-.gitignore
    -tell git to ignore our .env file
    
-.env 
    -not be uploaded to github. This will house all our local connection variables

-create.sql
    -Table creation for us

-insert.sql
    -Insertion of data

-query.sql
    -All of our sql queries

-demo.py
    -house a class that will run all of these for us at once
